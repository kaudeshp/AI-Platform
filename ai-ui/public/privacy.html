  <strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
</div>
<br />
<div class='innerText'>That said, CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. -  See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

  <strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>
</div>

<div class='innerText'>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online
  Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection
  agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's
  privacy and safety online.

  <strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>
</div>
<br />
<div class='innerText'>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include
  have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information
  Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
  personal information.
  <br>
  <br>
</div>
<div class='innerText'>
  <strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach
    occur:</strong>
</div>
<div class='innerText'>We will notify the users via in-site notification</div>
<div class='innerText'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <strong>&bull;</strong> Other</div>
<div class='innerText'>Within 365 days</div>
<div class='innerText'>
  <br>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
  rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals
  have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to
  investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</div>
